# Pokemon-Battle

Pokemon-Battle is a school assignment

PokemonBattle.java is a program that takes as input the names, Pokemon types, and levels of each Pokemon of both team. Information are stored in arrays. Then, a battle is created where each Pokemon compete with each other with the use of loops. The winning team is the one with the most surviving Pokemon. There is also a Critical Hit feature which instantly kills the opponent Pokemon hehe

BonusBattle.java is an updrage to PokemonBattle.java where a realistic battle is simulated. Both theam will compete until one team has no more Pokemon standing up and therefore the other team is the winner.

*All code was written by me except for the ratioBetween method and the enum at the end of both programs which are written by my teacher.
