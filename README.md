# Pokemon-Battle

Pokemon Battle is a school (Fall 2022) assignment I completed during my first semester at Dawson College in Computer Science Technology. It is a game to be played with a Linux command line such as Git Bash.

# How To Play The Basic Version

The basic version of Pokemon Battle takes as input the player's names, the Pokemon types, and the levels of each Pokemon of both team. This information is stored in arrays. Then, a battle is created where each Pokemon compete with each other with the use of loops. The winning team is the one with the most surviving Pokemon. There is also a Critical Hit feature which instantly kills the opponent Pokemon hehe

To play, run the following commands in your CLI :

```
javac PokemonBattle.java
java PokemonBattle
```

By now, the game is started and you'll just need to follow the instructions on the screen.

# How To Play The Upgraded Version

The upgraded version of Pokemon Battle simulates a battle that is more realistic than the basic version. Unlike that version which only plays six rounds to determine the winner, the upgraded version makes each team compete until one team's Pokemons are all no longer able to stand up and fight.

To play, run the following commands in your CLI :

```
javac BonusBattle.java
java BonusBattle
```

By now, the game is started and you'll just need to follow the instructions on the screen.

# Notes

All code was written by me except for the ratioBetween method and the enum PokemonType at the end of both programs which are written by my teacher.
